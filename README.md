An attempt at an Object Pascal Parser.

## Objectives

The main objective of this endeavour is primiraly to learn about tokenization and parsing, but it's also an attempt at decoupling the [Object Pascal LSP](https://github.com/genericptr/pascal-language-server) from Lazarus.

## Disclaimer

I'm not, in any way, remotely knowledgeable enough to even understand what I'm doing correctly or other wise.
This is my initial attempt at something like this, with only some tidbits of information, gathered here and there, in light conversations about the subject.

## Plea for help

I welcome any input, or __constructive__ criticism of this effort, since I'm quite aware that I'll need a **ton** of help with this thing!!
